Last thursday, Google released early versions of Gemini Pro - their generative AI APIs and I created a quick iOS prototype app to test our their vision models ðŸ‘€

- I gave it a photo of a receipt for a lunch we had in our team and asked it create a json of item names and prices âœ…

- I gave it a photo of my kid at Melbourne zoo and asked it to create an alt-text âœ…

I really do see there are some great usecases for Australian companies and sometimes I do wonder, why canâ€™t we be at the forefront of disruptive tech? Is there no room for innovating, and moving fast in large enterprises here? Is it a matter of risk - that only venture capital based Silicon Valley companies are well-versed in? I am going to leave this open-ended question out there and seek no answers.
