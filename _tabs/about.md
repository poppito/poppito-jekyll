Hey! My name is Harsh. It's spelled Harsh but actually you pronounce it like "Hersh". Nice to meet you.

I am an engineering and people leader with a background in building __good__ mobile apps that run on __good__ infrastructure -- and is backed by __good__ continuous delivery, based out of Melbourne, Australia - but that's my day job. Previously I have also worked at Telcos in Managed networks and security and built infrastructure that backs this for large and enterprise customers. Because I like problem solving, sometimes I get lured into building __good__ architecture.

I am an engineering and people leader with 16+ years in the industry and have worked on and supported teams that built infrastructure for 3 of the 4 largest banks in Australia - a collective scale of 20M+ users, as well as startups and consultancies and a large player in the Buy now, Pay Later and payments space. For more details you can have a quick squiz at my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hoverseer)

Previously I have also worked in Solution Architecture in the Telco space on Managed networks and security as well as hands-on engineer on infrastructure that backs this for large and enterprise level customers.

I also have a side-hustle - I publish apps and games on the Play and App stores. Almost all proceeds go to charity (and some to keep this domain and my apple dev subscription and firebase billing running!)
