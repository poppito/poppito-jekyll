Hey! My name is Harsh. It's spelled Harsh but actually you pronounce it like "Hersh". Nice to meet you.

I am an engineering and people leader with a background in building __good__ mobile apps that run on __good__ infrastructure -- and is backed by __good__ continuous delivery, based out of Melbourne, Australia - but that's my day job. Previously I have also worked at Telcos in Managed networks and security and built infrastructure that backs this for large and enterprise customers. Because I like problem solving, sometimes I get lured into building __good__ architecture.

I have worked on and built features for three of Australia's biggest banks as well as a large fintech in the buy now pay later space. You can take a look at my professional experience on my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hoverseer)

I like writing code in Swift, Kotlin, Python or scripting for *nix systems with a bit of the ol' bash. I __may__ have previously worked with AWS and GCP infrastructure also. When I am building games, I like Swift/SpriteKit/ARKit or cross-platform game development using Godot.

I also have a side-hustle - I publish apps and games on the Play and App stores. Almost all proceeds go to charity (and some to keep this domain and my apple dev subscription and firebase billing running!)
